# Classify-X-rays-using-CNN

The objectives of this CNN project is practice how to apply convolutional layer in image classification project. I trained three different model and compare their performance with `accuracy`,  `confusion matrix` and `classification report`. </br></br>
* Model 1: Using input, flatten and output layer to train model.
* Model 2: Using input, two convolutional layer, two MaxPooling2D layer, two dropout layer, flatten layer and output to train model.
* Model 3: Using ResNet50V2 as base model, it consists of 50 layers, including convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers.
